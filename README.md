# Hello-world
With the world heading towards an unknown, unpredictable future, I search to be a part of it. Computers and developing technology in this digital age is the future. I have worked hard with my hands as a commercial diver and now I wish to work with my mind.  I want to be a part of future and I feel that learning to code is the new skill. Where I can start and where I can change my life.

Go burritos, surfing, running, climbing
